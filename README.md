# Etch-A-Sketch

## The Odin Project - project series.

This is a project which solidifies on Javascript skills and gives a sense of how DOM manipulation works and how to get about modifying and implementing events in JS. The project's main goal is to create a Sketch grid which on hover allows you fill in color in a grid. The grid itself is customizable in terms of color, grid pixel size and erasing functions.
